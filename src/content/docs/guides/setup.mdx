## Requirements

- [GodotSteam 3.21](https://github.com/GodotSteam/GodotSteam/releases/tag/v3.21)
- [Godot RE Tools](https://github.com/bruvzg/gdsdecomp/releases/latest)

## Setting up the sample mod

The [sample mod](https://github.com/NotNite/WebfishingSampleMod) can help you get started quicker.

- Pick an ID for your project (WEBFISHING modders prefer the format of `AuthorName.ModName`).
- Clone the repository.
  - If you have a GitHub account, click "Use this template" and create a new repository named after your mod ID. You can then clone the repository locally using a Git client (like [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop)).
  - If you do not have a GitHub account, click "Code > Download ZIP".
- Delete `README.md`.
- Edit the values in `manifestation.toml` to match your mod.
- Update the icon (unless you want a :3 face on your Thunderstore page). It must be 256x256 in size.

## Decompiling the game project

In Godot RE Tools, select "RE Tools > Recover project" and pick "Full Recovery". You can then open the resulting project in the Godot editor.

:::caution
**Never export from the decompiled project!** Exporting from the decompiled project will include vanilla game assets in the exported .pck, no matter what includes/excludes you set. This will break the game on updates and cause mod incompatibilities.

## Making your mod

What you do next depends on what your mod will be. If you plan to edit existing game scripts, your mod will need to be written (partially or fully) in C#. If you plan to add new assets or make new scripts, your mod will need to be made in the Godot editor.

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="Modding in the Godot editor"
    description="For custom assets and scripts"
    href="/webfishing-mod-wiki/guides/modding-godot"
  />

  <LinkCard
    title="Modding with C#"
    description="For editing existing game scripts"
    href="/webfishing-mod-wiki/guides/modding-csharp"
  />
</CardGrid>

If you don't need one of the two projects (which is likely), delete the project and remove the reference in `manifestation.toml`.

## Publishing your mod

The sample mod uses [manifestation](/webfishing-mod-wiki/tools/manifestation/) for packaging. See the dedicated page for more information.

You can upload the resulting zip files to your GitHub repository's releases and to Thunderstore.
